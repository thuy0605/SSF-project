# SSF-project
This project is about ChatBoxAI. The idea is that this chat app will combine with OpenAI and be used for anyone. 

- User Interaction: Users interact with ChatBoxAI by typing queries or requirements into the chat interface provided by the frontend application.

- Backend Processing: Receiving user inputs, the frontend forwards the content to the backend infrastructure of ChatBoxAI. The backend reformats the content as necessary and prepares it for submission to the OpenAI API.

- OpenAI Response: The backend sends API requests to OpenAI, providing the reformatted user input as input data. OpenAI processes the input, generates a suitable response based on contextual understanding, and returns the response to the backend.

- Response Delivery: Receiving the response from OpenAI, the backend forwards it to the frontend application. The frontend displays the response to the user, completing the communication cycle.
