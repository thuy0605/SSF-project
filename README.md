# SSF-project

This project is about ChatBoxAI. The idea is that this chat app will combine with OpenAI and be used for anyone.

User Interaction: Users interact with ChatBoxAI by typing queries or requirements into the chat interface provided by the frontend application.
Backend Processing: Receiving user inputs, the frontend forwards the content to the backend infrastructure of ChatBoxAI. The backend reformats the content as necessary and prepares it for submission to the OpenAI API.
OpenAI Response: The backend sends API requests to OpenAI, providing the reformatted user input as input data. OpenAI processes the input, generates a suitable response based on contextual understanding, and returns the response to the backend.
Response Delivery: Receiving the response from OpenAI, the backend forwards it to the frontend application. The frontend displays the response to the user, completing the communication cycle.
